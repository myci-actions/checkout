= checkout github sources using git

This action is a replacement of standard github's `actions/checkout` action.
This action is implemented as `composite action`, so it does not require `node.js` interpreter.
The standard `actions/checkout` is written in `javascript` and sometimes it is not possible to have `node12` injected to the container.

= prerequisites

- `git` must be available. So, make sure `git` is installed before calling this action.
